    "section": "Architectural choices",
    "text": "Architectural choices\nThe architectural choices for connecting Hungarian music and folklore datasets to a future-proof, interoperable infrastructure must address three simultaneous challenges:\n(1) historically layered and multilingual heritage;\n(2) highly heterogeneous and partly undocumented legacy databases; and\n(3) limited institutional capacity for large-scale ontology engineering.\nFor these reasons, we have focused on Wikibase as the core bridging technology. Its suitability is demonstrated most clearly by the National Library of Wales’ SNARC (Shared National Archival Record Catalogue) architecture, which has already been adopted as a model by cultural-heritage institutions across Europe. SNARC is a directly relevant precedent for HH, because it supports exactly the combination of requirements present in Hungary: distributed collections, multilingual metadata, legacy databases, and active community contributors.\nWikibase has proven effective for multilingual authority control (Bianchini, Bargioni, and Pellizzari di San Girolamo 2021; Fagerving 2023). The Finnish Wikibase pilot of the National Library of Finland demonstrated how it can connect museum, linguistic, and archival records while also supporting community participation (National Library of Finland 2021). Similar experiences in minority-language contexts—such as the Võro User Group (Wikimedians of Võro language User Group 2025) and Wikimedia Norge’s Sámi knowledge project (Wikimedia Norge 2020)—show that Wikibase can combine semantic interoperability with respect for knowledge sovereignty and multilingual representation. These experiences are particularly suitable for connecting to less formal civic or community, municipal diaspora Hungarian collections. These precedents confirm that Wikibase can act as a shared, multilingual curatorial platform for minority and diasporic heritage without imposing a single institutional metadata regime.\nThe relevance of the Welsh precedent is explicitly confirmed in the documents the National Library has made public and is also reflected in the wider scholarly literature, and given the institutional strength of the Welsh National Library, it is probably the highest scaled subnational example. As summarised in our internal materials:\n\n“A notable example is the SNARC Wikibase… developed by the National Library of Wales. SNARC allows Welsh libraries, archives, and museums to describe cultural heritage using persistent identifiers and structured metadata in Welsh and English. It supports shared authority work and multilingual reconciliation while respecting institutional diversity and community input.”\n\nThis architecture provides not only a technical blueprint but also a governance model that suits a heritage ecosystem with many semi-independent contributors, including fieldworkers, regional archives, civic initiatives, and diasporic communities.\nWikibase offers an effective bridge between human-centred curatorial workflows and the formal structures of the semantic web. As an open, collaborative platform, it enables curators, researchers, and community partners to describe heritage materials in a readable, intuitive format, while simultaneously maintaining machine-actionable semantics through RDF export. This duality makes Wikibase particularly suitable for projects that must combine community participation, multilingual metadata, and interoperability with formal ontologies such as HDTO (ECCCH), CIDOC-CRM (museums), Records in Contexts (archives), and DCTERMS)2.\nIn contexts characterised by limited archival depth, legacy databases of uneven quality, or undocumented local schema variations, strict ontology-based systems can easily become too rigid for practical curation. Wikibase, by contrast, supports incremental enrichment. Incomplete, contradictory, or uncertain statements can coexist with qualified assertions, references, and provenance notes. Curators can therefore record uncertainty—an intrinsic part of folkloristic and ethnographic data—without compromising the coherence of the underlying semantic structures.\nIts flexible data model also allows domain ontologies to be introduced progressively: digital-twin classes, heritage-entity relations, component hierarchies, and temporal layers can be added over time without disrupting existing documentation practices. This progressive modelling principle is essential for a project like HH, where archival quality, provenance depth, and historical metadata formats vary significantly across collections.\n\nThe Welsh Model: Why SNARC Is the Most Relevant Precedent\nSNARC demonstrates how Wikibase can operate as a national-level authority and reconciliation layer for distributed archives. Its architecture exhibits several properties that map directly onto the needs of Hungarian folklore collections:\n\nMultilingual authority control with community participation: SNARC maintains bilingual (Welsh/English) labels, descriptions, and authority records, enabling minority and regional languages to coexist with national cataloguing standards. This aligns with HH’s need to support Hungarian, regional dialects, and minority languages across the Carpathian Basin.\nA federated approach rather than centralisation: Institutions retain autonomy over their internal databases, while contributing shared authority data into the Wikibase layer. This mirrors the governance model recommended we followed with the prototyping in the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space, and fits in with the situation in Hungary: HH must integrate data from diverse field researchers, local cultural centres, and legacy scholarly collections without imposing a single catalogue.\nSupport for weakly standardised, legacy, and community-derived data: SNARC deals with inconsistent archival metadata, variant place names, historical spellings, and ambiguous provenance—challenges identical to those found in Hungarian folklore collections.\nA sustainable governance model: Wikibase enables contributors, stewards, validators, and reviewers to participate according to their role. This matches HH’s needs: ethnomusicologists, dance researchers, ethnographers, and community collectors can contribute in different capacities.\nCompatibility with semantic-web export: SNARC relies on Wikibase’s RDF layer to integrate with external linked-data infrastructures—analogous to our plan to export to HDTO/ECCCH and other European data spaces.\n\n\n\nWikibase as a Bridging Layer in Heritage Architectures\nArchitecturally, Wikibase functions as a bridging layer between descriptive archives (AtoM, legacy field-record tables, digitised notebooks, manuscript metadata) and semantic infrastructures capable of supporting cross-institutional reasoning. It links curatorial work with graph-based analytics through:\n\nFederated SPARQL queries\nMultilingual labels and aliases\nReconciliation services\nVersioned, provenance-rich authority records\nIncremental modelling of heritage ontologies\n\nThis architecture has been tested extensively in the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space, where it supports the representation of complex, multilingual, and historically layered heritage in a transparent, sustainable form. Human curators maintain an accessible knowledge base; automated pipelines generate HDTO-compliant linked-data exports for long-term interoperability.\nFor the HH pilot, we will therefore:\n\nUse the existing, well-curated Finno-Ugric Wikibase instance to test small sample datasets.\nEvaluate feasibility and governance requirements for establishing one or two dedicated Wikibase instances:\n– a public-facing authority and catalogue layer,\n– and, if necessary, a more detailed internal-facing instance for sensitive or partially processed data.\nThis staged approach mirrors the Welsh model, where the public Wikibase instance aggregates reconciled data, while institutions retain internal systems tailored to their operational needs.\n\n\n\nSubsidiarity in Data Governance: Proven Suitability for Minority, Regional, and Diasporic Heritage\nThe suitability of Wikibase for complex cultural ecosystems is supported by comparative examples:\n– the National Library of Finland’s Wikibase pilot,\n– the Võro User Group’s regional-language knowledge base,\n– Wikimedia Norge’s Sámi metadata projects,\n– and other community-based knowledge initiatives.\nThese projects demonstrate that Wikibase can combine semantic interoperability with knowledge sovereignty, a crucial requirement for representing the diverse, often community-generated folklore and folk-music heritage that HH oversees.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The opening page at https://reprexbase.eu/fu/index.php for the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space\n\n\nWithin the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space, this approach allows complex, multilingual, and historically layered heritage to be represented transparently and sustainably: human curators maintain an accessible knowledge base, while automated exports produce HDTO-compliant datasets for long-term interoperability. We will test this well-developed and curated Wikibase instance for the first phase of testing small data samples from HH, then we review the feasibility of building one or two dedciated (for example, public facing and separate internal facing) instances for HH.\n\n\nAlignment with European Research Infrastructures\nReprex aligns the Wikibase data model with the Heritage Digital Twin Ontology(HDTO), the semantic backbone of the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH). This alignment ensures that HH’s data will be future-proof, interoperable with European heritage clouds, and ready for integration into AI-assisted digital humanities tools.\nIn this respect, Wikibase functions not merely as a curatorial interface, but as an enabling architecture for open, interoperable cultural-heritage data within the emerging European research and data-space ecosystem."

    "text": "Viability and competences\nBecause Reprex works with very similar data from the Latvian Folk Archive, and various smaller Nordic and Baltic collections, and Hungarian and Slovak repertoire data, we are importing into the current datasets a small subset of Folk Tales Inventory [Népmeseleltár], in short: FTI Example Dataset, and the A Székelyföld népi tánczene szempontú táji tagolódása – 500 hangzó példa, in short, Szekler dance music dataset created by Pávai, István to demonstrate on a small scale the value, usability and problems of the broader collections of HH.\nThese datasets, as much as it is possible, will be converted and added to the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space (FUDSS), a non-profit, research data sharing space that connects various Finno-Ugric immaterial and material culture in formats that are interoperable with libraries, archives, museums, Europeana, Daria-H, and the European Culture Heritage Cloud.\nFUDSS only stores metadata and does not take away any published HH material; it will link back to the Szekler dance music dataset. It will expose a small subset, probably ~50 tales with connected bibliographical entries from FTI Example Dataset, which is less than 0.5% of the contents of the original data source.\nThe aim of this direction is:\n\nto evaluate to what extent the current data models developed by Reprex with the Latvian Folk Archive and other similar organisations can be directly applicable to HH;\nto gain hands-on graph building, reviewing, editing experience to the HH team;\nto expose various professional questions in the entire data curation workflow (technical, semantic, scalability or legal)\n\nAt the same time, HH colleagues will write competency questions to the expected graph, which we hope to be able to answer by querying the FUDSS in SPARQL. The competency questions should be organised like this.\n\nA Székelyföld népi tánczene szempontú táji tagolódása – 500 hangzó példa\nCompetences expected from importing to the FUDSS graph:\n\nWhich example items were in use in Gyergyóremete?\nWhich example items were collected by Pávai, István?\nWhat musical instruments appear in Pávai’s examples?\nWhich instrumental ensembles appear among Pávai’s examples?\nIn which example does a clarinet appear?\nIn which folk region is the dance called korcsos found?\nWhat cultural micro-regions belong to the Marosszék cultural (meso)region?\nFrom which Bartók collections (location and date of collection) did István Pávai select his examples?\n\nAfter enriching the graph with Linked Open Data:\n\nWhich collector worked in Remetea [with the addition of multi-language gazetteer], for methodology see Remapping the Livonian Coast: A Multilingual Gazetteer of the Settlements of Northern Kurzeme (Antal, Pigozne, and Mester 2025).\nWhich example items were collected within 25 kms from 46°15'8.96\"N, 25°26'5.86\"E. We enriched Abásfalva-Aldea with geographical coordianates and Geonames PID (686517); a simple distance function can be built in a query that answers this question and lists other collection locations that fall into the radius.\nWhich publications of the collector Agócs, Gergely are available in OSZK and other libraries?\nWhich settlements in the collection have a proportion of Hungarian population below 50% according to the 2021 Romanian census?\n\nAfter feasibility accomplished:\n\nWhich publications of the collector Bartók, Béla are available in library of HH\nWhich original audio tapes on inventory are connected to the collector Pávai, István\nWhich collection can be listened to in its entirety in the Folklore Database (Folklóradatbázis)?\nWhich original media can be listened to in its entirety in the ZTI Sound Archive?\n\n\n\nFolk Tales Inventory [Népmeseleltár]\nWe placed about 120 folk tales from Transylvania into our database. These entries are not the abstract tales, but their textual manifestations as they were described in Konsza, Samu: Háromszéki magyar népköltészet [Folk Poetry of Háromszék] and made available originally by the State Publishing House for Literature and Arts / Állami Irodalmi és Művészeti Kiadó, and currently by Adatbank (fudss:Q5823)].\nWe used the following modelling solutions:\n\nWe placed Competences expected from importing to the FUDSS graph:\n\n\nWhich tales were published in Magyar Nyelvőr in the year 1888?\nWhich tales were collected in Mohács?\nWhich tales were collected by Ortutay, Gyula?\n\nAfter enriching the graph with Linked Open Data:\n\nWhich collector worked in Берегуйфалу [requires addition of multi-language gazetteer]\nWhich example items were collected within 25 kms from 48°16’36”N, 22°48’28”E\nWhich publications of the collector [Ortutay, Gyula] are available in OSZK?\nWhat did Samu Konsza look like?\nWhere was Samu Konsza born and where did he die?\n\nAfter feasibility accomplished:\n\nWhich publications of the collector [Ortutay, Gyula] are available in library the of HH?\nWhich original fieldnote documents are connected to the collector Ortutay, Gyula?\n\n\n\nAtoM integration and round-trip validation\nHagyományok Háza (HH) aims to migrate its archival descriptions in the Access to Memory system (AtoM). To ensure that the proposed semantic-web workflow is compatible with the planned archival practices, the pilot includes a round-trip interoperability test between AtoM and the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space (FUDSS).\nIn this phase, a small number of AtoM records will be exported in standard archival formats (EAD and EAC-CPF) and imported into the FUDSS Wikibase environment. These items will be modelled using the same pragmatic linked-data patterns applied to the FTI Example Dataset and the Szekler dance music dataset. After modelling and basic semantic enrichment, the records will be exported back to AtoM-compatible representations.\nThis round-trip test allows us to evaluate whether entity identifiers, personal and geographical names, roles, provenance fields, and relationships survive the full cycle of import, modelling, enrichment, and re-export without structural loss or semantic distortion. Success will be demonstrated if a small number of enriched items can be re-ingested into AtoM and remain usable within its archival description workflows.\nThe National Library of Wales follows a similar model in its Shared National Archival Record Catalogue (SNARC), where Wikibase acts as a reconciling and multilingual authority layer while traditional archival systems continue to provide the core descriptive functions. Our test will assess the feasibility of adopting this architectural pattern at Hagyományok Háza."

    "section": "Modelling pragmatism",
    "text": "Modelling pragmatism\nOur solution is the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space, a lightweight, federated infrastructure that supports participatory metadata repair, semantic enrichment, and multilingual modelling. Technically, our infrastructure connects CIDOC CRM-based museum records, DCTERMS-based library metadata, and Wikibase lexemes through shared patterns, allowing heterogeneous sources to interoperate without enforcing a single monolithic schema.\n\nAuthority control\nRobust authority control is essential for maintaining data quality and semantic precision in a multilingual knowledge graph. It ensures that persons, organisations, and places are uniquely identified across systems and over time.\nPersonal and Corporate Names\nAll creators, collectors, and institutions must be associated with permanent, globally recognised identifiers. We rely on:\n\nVIAF – international library authority file (including OSZK).\nORCID – the preferred identifier for researchers.\nISNI – ISO-standard name registry.\nWikidata QIDs – decentralised identifiers linking VIAF, ORCID, ISNI.\nMagyar Nemzeti Névtér – currently inactive but conceptually aligned.\n\nVIAF and ORCID offer strong interoperability with ISNI and Wikidata. For historical bibliographic entities, VIAF is generally most reliable; for living contributors in research workflows, ORCID is preferred. ISNI functions as a high-quality fallback, while Wikidata provides a fully open alternative with community-based validation. Authority files also preserve spelling variants and legacy forms (e.g., Ferencz), supporting historical continuity.\nOur work draws on established approaches to multilingual authority control (Bianchini, Bargioni, and Pellizzari di San Girolamo 2021; Fagerving 2023). Comparative models—from the National Library of Wales and Wikimedia UK (Evans 2025), through the semi-institutionalised Võro User Group (Wikimedians of Võro language User Group 2025), to the fully community-driven Sámi project in Norway (Wikimedia Norge 2020)—demonstrate how multilingual reconciliation can be embedded in institutional, semi-formal, or community-led infrastructures.\nIn our project, collectors, authors, and—where legally permissible—data subjects were reconciled with relevant authority files. This yielded two primary benefits:\n\nstronger interoperability with library and research systems;\nidentification and correction of inconsistent or duplicate metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisambiguation and repair\n\n\n\nDozdovszky, Zoltán (fudss:Q6370) illustrates this issue. His name appeared in multiple inconsistent spellings in the source dataset. Authority reconciliation consolidated these variants into a single identity.\n\n\nGraph-based linking thus enables metadata repair that would be cumbersome in relational databases, where fuzzy matching must be used without authoritative grounding.\n\n\nGeographical Gazetteer\nPlace names show even greater variability than personal names, especially in multi-ethnic regions. To manage this, we constructed a multilingual geographic reconciliation layer (gazetteer) to align historical and modern toponyms.\nOur initial focus was the FTI Example Dataset, covering part of Székelyföld. For example, Gyergyóremete (fudss:Q5730) has multiple culturally relevant appellations:\nGyergyóremete (fudss::Q5730)\n├─ has label (en) → Remetea, alias Gyergyoremete\n├─ has label (ro) → Remetea, alias Gyergyoremete\n├─ has label (hu) → Gyergyóremete, alias Remetea\n├─ coordinate location → 46°47’36.71”N, 25°27’1.01”E\n└─ Geonames ID https://www.geonames.org/668986\nWe use the current official name (Remetea) for English-language systems, while retaining historical and culturally meaningful variants for multilingual discovery. ASCII-normalised aliases ensure compatibility with search interfaces lacking diacritics. Wikibase’s UI handles all these variants gracefully through its label–alias lookup.\nWe treat Gyergyóremete as a place appellation, reflecting a cultural concept rather than an administrative boundary. Heritage materials relate to this conceptual locality even when municipal borders shift.\nFor broader regions such as Háromszék, midpoint coordinates are insufficient. Boundary polygons (e.g., from OpenStreetMap) or explicit hierarchical relations are required to support reasoning about inclusion.\nOur workflow follows a bottom-up strategy: starting from raw tabular values and incrementally introducing higher-level spatial hierarchies. This mirrors our Livonian Coast Gazetteer, derived from The Livonian Place Name Catalogue (Ernštreits, Šuvcāne, and Damberg 2024; Antal, Pigozne, and Mester 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenRefine\n\n\n\nAll reconciliation steps are documented using OpenRefine and integrated into our tutorial book.\n\n\n\n\nThesaurus and Ontology Patterns\nParallel to geographic reconciliation, we translated and graph-integrated a subset of HH’s internal thesaurus, aligning it pragmatically with the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus® (AAT) (Harpring et al. 2020; Silva 2022). We used a label-focused approach, retaining AAT’s upper-level conceptual structure while introducing local subclasses where appropriate.\nThis balances broad discoverability with ontological precision. General terms (e.g., lakodalom) serve as human-friendly entry points, while more specific concepts emerge through iterative refinement. This follows the principle of ontology seeding (Maria Teresa, Stellato, and Vindigni 2012; Maria Teresa and Stellato 2012), combining automated extraction with expert correction.\nOur approach aligns with the Semantic Web “layer cake” model (Mayank, Craig A., and Pedro 2021), where vocabularies like AAT and CIDOC CRM occupy the semantic middle layer. CIDOC CRM itself functions more as a modelling dialect than as a rigid ontology (Bekiari et al. 2024), and archival metadata adds additional complexity as institutions transition from legacy standards, such as ISAD(G), to Records in Contexts (RiC) (Archives Expert Group on Archival Description 2023).\nTo address this heterogeneity, we emphasise modular ontological patterns rather than comprehensive global alignment. Drawing on eXtreme Design and recent work in the Polifonia Ontology Family (Blomqvist, Hammar, and Presutti 2016; Berardinis et al. 2023), we extract reusable fragments that support low-friction cross-domain linking. Rather than “ontological hijacking,” we formalise recurring vernacular patterns found in AAT, Wikidata, and community vocabularies alike.\nThis positions our work at the interface between general-purpose ontologies and community-specific modelling. Our aim is not to replace established standards but to complement them—enabling smaller, underrepresented knowledge systems to participate in linked-data infrastructures without flattening epistemic diversity. Governance, multilingual support, and contextual sensitivity are built into this architecture from the outset.\n\n\nFolk tales\nWe mapped the Meseleltár to a text-manifestation class. The chapter class is well established in museum, library, and web ontologies (crm:E31_Document, frbroo:F24_Publication_Expression, schema:Chapter):\nchapter\n├─ book section (unnumbered) (fudss::Q5818)\n└─ folk tale textual manifestation (fudss:Q5819)\nExample:\nThe Wolf, the Bear and the Hussar (folk tale manifestation) → https://reprexbase.eu/fu/Item:Q5820\nThe corresponding abstract work is modelled as a subclass of literary work without individual authorship. Later iterations will connect abstract tales to international taxonomies (e.g., ATU types), enabling linkage of textual manifestations, audio recordings, and fieldwork variants.\nThe Wolf, the Bear and the Hussar (folk tale) ([fudss::Q5820])\n└─ has taxonomical entry → ATU type\n└─ has manifestation → folk tale text manifestation ([fudss::Q5826])\n└─ is curated member of → Meseleltár\n└─ published in → Háromszéki magyar népköltészet ([fudss:Q5815])\n└─ is heritage of → Székelys\nThe property is heritage of derives from the Heritage Digital Twin Ontology (HDTO), supporting connections to legal and policy frameworks such as Hungaricum registries or national cultural-content classifications.\nMeseleltár ([fudss:Q5825])\n└─ instance of → collection\nThe is curated member of relationship provides transparent curatorial provenance. New tales can be added; erroneous entries can be corrected or removed. The publication node (Háromszéki magyar népköltészet) is treated as a standard book object and can be linked to external library systems.\nFor usability, we attach has access point directly both to the publication node and to individual tale manifestations so that Sampo-UI displays a direct download link for each item, even though this introduces a small amount of formal redundancy."

    "text": "Ethical and legal considerations\nAlongside FAIR and the 8-star model, we also considered the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) (Carroll et al. 2020). While these principles were formulated in Indigenous contexts such as North America and Oceania, they offer relevant guidance for Finno-Ugric heritage. The situation of these communities is heterogeneous: Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians are nation-states with strong institutional infrastructures; Seto, Võro, Csángó or Szekler communities are integrated minorities with various level of community rights, formal and informal organisations, and ability to use their languages. Our DSS adapts CARE to this environment by prioritizing multilingual metadata accessibility, cultural reassembly, and safe avenues for community review, while acknowledging that not all CARE provisions can be applied in the same way.\nRights management within the FinFAIR framework is designed to be transparent, interoperable, and machine-readable.\nIt combines the Heritage Digital Twin Ontology (HDTO) with practical extensions in Wikibase that allow curators to express not only licences but also contextual usage rules derived from the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL).\nWhile large digital-heritage platforms such as Europeana or DARIAH rely mainly on single-URI licence models (edm:rights, dcterms:license), FinFAIR adds an optional layer of structured use policies to handle complex, multimodal works such as music or film, where overlapping rights coexist.\n\nPersonal Data and GDPR\nEvery hdt:HC1_HeritageEntity or hdt:HC2_HeritageDigitalTwin may link to living agents—performers, collectors, researchers, donors, or other data subjects—through dcterms:creator, prov:wasAttributedTo, or crm:P14_carried_out_by.\nUnder the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), these names constitute personal data.\nBefore publication or linkage, consent and attribution are evaluated:\n\nAttribution — if the person consents to credit, we use cc:attributionName.\nPseudonymisation — if consent is uncertain, we use neutral labels, e.g. “Field recording performer, 1962”.\nAnonymity — if the person requests privacy, all identifying information is withheld.\nThe selected attribution mode determines the applicable licence.\n\nFor example, CC-BY assumes credit, while pseudonymised or anonymous materials default to CC0, BY-NC, or a corresponding rightsstatements.org URI.\nFor older archival materials, FinFAIR follows Europeana’s approach: if the data subjects are certainly deceased (typically pre-1925), personal-data restrictions no longer apply.\n\n\nSimple Case: One Licence per File\nFor non-composite objects—photographs, scans, or plain-text documents—the Europeana Data Model (EDM) edm:rights field provides sufficient legal clarity.\nFinFAIR implements this directly via the Wikibase property use rights, which corresponds to dcterms:license and edm:rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven these “simple” cases are dynamic. A copyright protection term may expire, making a less accessible item fully reusable under the public domain. Rightsholders may change their minds, and give a more permissive license, for example, change from CC BY-NC-ND to CC-BY-SA, allowing commercial use and derivate works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of object\nHDTO class\nTypical examples\n\n\n\n\nDigital text\nhdt:HC6_DigitalDocument\nmetadata exports, lyrics, PDFs\n\n\nDigital image\nhdt:HC7_DigitalVisualObject\nphotographs, scans, blueprints\n\n\nSimple audio file\nhdt:HC5_DigitalRepresentation\nsingle, unambiguous recordings\n\n\n\nEach digital component carries:\n- use rights → a URI pointing to a standard licence (e.g. CC-BY, CC0);\n- optional provenance (dcterms:rightsHolder, dcterms:accessRights, dcterms:provenance).\nThe composite digital twin (HC2) aggregates multiple components but does not override their licences.\nWhen reused, the most restrictive licence among components applies."
