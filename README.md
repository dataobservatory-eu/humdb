# Hungarian Music Database

**A replication of the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database**

## Main files


`HH.qmd`: This working paper presents an initial feasibility study on 
how the Hungarian Heritage House’s folklore, folk-music, and 
narrative-heritage collections can be represented in a multilingual, 
interoperable knowledge-graph environment. Using small pilot subsets of 
the Szekler dance-music collection and the Folk Tale Inventory, 
the study tests authority reconciliation, geographic gazetteers, 
thesaurus alignment, and AtoM round-trip interoperability within 
the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space. The work forms part of a broader 
effort to establish a Hungarian music data sharing space inspired by the 
Slovak Comprehensive Music Database and the 
Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space, and evaluates the suitability of 
Wikibase, HDTO, and ECCCH as sustainable foundations for 
modernising HH’s digital heritage infrastructure. View the document
