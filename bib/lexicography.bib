abstract="The article considers the special class of ontology-driven lexicographic systems. The principles of their formation and use for processing large numbers of network documents are described. The rules of interaction with network information resources based on transformation of text documents into an interactive format are presented. The rules of formation of ontological systems that implement document structuring functions, the information display functions and functional management are described. The process of formation of monodiciplinary and multidisciplinary L-systems is described. The principles of formation of semiotically and semantically organized information environment are described. The definition of lexicographic effect is given. The hyperproperty of the inductance of a set of elementary information units (EIU) is presented. The flexibility of ontologies is described, which makes them a convenient mechanism for describing almost any data structure, so in addition to the actual EIU and their descriptions (i.e. information processed by the system). An ontology-driven system architecture is defined for a class of lexicographic systems. This architecture implements procedures of taxonomy-based management, which allows dynamic change of the set of available functions, interfaces, and so on. The operations that implement transdisciplinary integration of arbitrary documents in active modes of interaction are defined.",

	abstract = {Developed by the Getty Vocabulary Program, the Art \& Architecture Thesaurus® ({AAT}) is a tool for cataloging and indexing works of art and other cultural objects. It was begun in 1979 by a group of librarians who needed specific art terms for cataloging art information. In the early 1980s, the {AAT} was incorporated into the Getty Art History Information Program. Originally comprising only English terms, it has become more inclusive over the years through translation into other languages, including Portuguese. The first Portuguese translation project began in 2016; the second project began in 2020 and was made possible through the Getty Graduate Internship Program. These {AAT} translation projects facilitate the access and retrieval of art collection information by Portuguese-language users around the world.},
